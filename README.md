# 🎀 Princess Studio: Coding as Dressing

> **"Coding is the fine art of thoughts."**
> A high-fashion, *Princess Maker 4* inspired IDE that translates complex code logic into elegant royal outfits.

## 🌟 Overview

**Princess Studio** is an experimental AI-powered coding environment that bridges the gap between **Software Engineering** and **Aesthetic Design**. Using Google Gemini 3 Pro and Flash models, it converts natural language programming requirements into:
1. **Clean Code**: Executable, high-quality logic.
2. **Couture Mapping**: A pedagogical translation of code structures (loops, variables, APIs) into fashion elements (lace, jewelry, tailoring).
3. **Visual Representation**: AI-generated character illustrations wearing the "Code-Gown" generated from your logic.

## 🎨 The "Coding as Dressing" Philosophy

We believe that code quality shares the same principles as high-end tailoring:
- **Frontend (UI/UX) = Fabric & Silhouette**: The touch, drape, and first impression.
- **Backend (Logic) = Tailoring & Support**: The internal stitching that determines durability and fit.
- **Refactoring = Wardrobe Capsule**: Streamlining redundancy while keeping the essentials.
- **Clean Code = Minimalism**: The "Old Money" aesthetic—functional, timeless, and devoid of unnecessary clutter.

## 🚀 Features

- **Magick Command Line**: Input your programming wishes in natural language.
- **Princess Mirror (Visualizer)**: See your code come to life as a bespoke outfit for your digital princess.
- **IDE Explorer**: A VSCode-style file management interface for organizing your "Magic Blueprints."
- **Atelier Report**: Deep-dive analysis into the aesthetic mapping of your logic.
- **Attribute System**: Track your code's *Elegance*, *Clarity*, and *Power* levels.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework**: React 19 + TypeScript

## 📜 How to Use

1. **Clone the repository.**
2. **Set your Gemini API Key**: Ensure `process.env.API_KEY` is configured.
3. **Start the Studio**: `npm start` or run via your preferred hosting.
4. **Input a Command**: E.g., *"Create a function that sorts a list of rose petals by color."*
5. **Observe the Magic**: Watch the code appear and see the princess change into an outfit that represents that specific logic.
